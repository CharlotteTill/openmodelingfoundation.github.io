We focus on minimum standards to reach a high level of adoption which will improve the quality of documentation a lot across the field. For purposes of this document, the word \u0026lsquo;model\u0026rsquo; is shorthand for \u0026lsquo;computational model program\u0026rsquo;: a computer code that generates a numerical solution to one or more mathematical or algorithmic models of a natural and/or human system. This is a living document and comments are welcomed and will be addressed by the OMF standards committee. The minimum standards aim to capture concerns and practices among the members of OMF. Individual application domains could design adjusted and enhanced standards that capture specifics of that application domain.\nDocumentation and Code Documentation of a model, together with the provided model code, needs to facilitate the understanding of the intentions of the developer, and make the model easier to test, use, and link to other models.

Modeling is critical to enhancing analytical and decision-making capabilities for policy and planning, environmental management, resource investment, and security preparedness. We need a new generation of scientific computational models drawn from the social, ecological, biological, environmental, and geophysical sciences that can work together to provide an integrated representation of the complex world in which we now live. This vision can be realized through a common suite of standards, protocols, and best practices that enables modeling scientists to share knowledge and build on one another\u0026rsquo;s research.\n Mission and Goals The Open Modeling Foundation (OMF) is an international open science community that works to enable the next generation modeling of human and natural systems. The Open Modeling Foundation is an alliance of modeling organizations that coordinates and administers a common, community developed body of standards and best practices among diverse communities of modeling scientists. It also provides informational, data, and technological resources to facilitate the implementation of common standards and best practices among the scientific communities it serves.\nThe OMF supports the work of all modeling scientists endeavoring to advance the understanding of diverse dimensions of our complexly interacting human and natural world. The OMF promotes cooperation and transparent knowledge exchange among modeling scientists through common standards and best practices. The OMF develops and maintains an open-access, community framework for enabling an ecosystem of reusable, interoperable models to study complex interactions between people and the environment at multiple scales. The OMF allows scientists and planners world-wide to contribute to developing modeling approaches and applying them to help sustainably manage our planet. Because sustainability is a global challenge, it is important to engage the world in developing and deploying the science needed for this endeavor, and democratize advanced modeling to ensure that all members of our global human community have access to the scientific and decision tools they need.\nThe OMF endeavors to accelerate modeling science by making models more easily discoverable and globally accessible. It also develops and administers a suite of common standards and technology for model reusability, reproducibility, and interoperability. The foundation supports training and educational programs that help modeling scientists develop their skills, learn best practices, and share expertise. OMF member organizations promote transparency and ethical practice of crediting the work of modeling scientists in all domains.\nIn these ways, the Open Modeling Foundation seeks to enable the many scientists across the world who are represented by its member organizations to contribute to nimble, effective modeling of natural systems, human systems, and their integration at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Through fostering innovative modeling science, the Open Modeling Foundation endeavors to help humanity confront rapidly changing and ever more complex and global issues, and improve human well-being.\n Activities The Open Modeling Foundation carries out a series of coordinated activities to further its vision, mission, and goals under the guidance and with the support of the OMF Executive Directorate, Members Council, Working Groups, and member organizations. These activities include, but are not limited to the following.\nCommunity Standards for Modeling Science The OMF coordinates and administers the development or adoption of pan-community standards that accelerate knowledge scaffolding among modeling scientists, and promote the creation and use of more reusable, replicable, interoperable, and reliable models. These standards include:\n  Discoverability and Accessibility: Standards for accessibility ensure that model code is available in FAIR-aligned digital repositories (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reproducible) and that model developers receive public recognition and professional credit for code they make accessible in this way.\n  Documentation: Standards for model documentation ensure that information accompanying model code is sufficiently comprehensive to enable others besides a model developer to understand and potentially replicate the purpose and operation of a model.\n  Reusability and Replicability: Standards aim to facilitate the reuse of a model by others beyond the context in which the model was originally developed; for computational models this includes reusability regardless of the operating system or language in which a model was originally developed. Replicability is not possible without reusability.\n  Interoperability: Standards to enable potential interoperability among different models include pan-community external API and vocabulary (ontology) specifications.\n  The OMF coordinates and administers the certification of models that meet these standards and the assignment of badges or other public indicators of such certification to the general modeling community for code that meets these standards. The OMF also encourages and coordinates peer review of models by the scientific community and other evaluation activities, like model intercomparison programs, to help identify models that meet community standards, and enhance the reliability and value of models.\nOMF modeling standards are living documents that should be reviewed and updated as technology and the needs of the international modeling community evolve. The OMF welcomes and encourages input on standards from members of the broader modeling community and will consider that input as part of the formal standards-making, review, and approval procedures.\nIn addition to standards applicable to model code, the OMF also develops, adopts, and administers community-wide standards for ethical practice by modeling scientists. In order to encourage knowledge exchanges and scaffolding, all modeling scientists should publically credit (normally through citation) the work of any other scientists that they use. In order to maintain the reliability and public reputation of modeling science, practitioners must document accurately model purposes, operations, inputs, boundaries, assumptions, and results. Modeling scientists are also strongly urged to make all models transparent and open to external examination, and to make their models openly accessible to others.\nThese standards for models and modeling science practice are disseminated to all member organizations and publicly displayed on the OMF website.\nResources to Facilitate Model Discoverability, Accessibility, Reuse and Interoperability The OMF may coordinate or develop technologies and databases to help modeling scientists make their models more easily reusable by others and more easily interoperable with other models. Examples of such resources could be software or online services to help scientists containerize computational models in environments like Docker, to transform them into web services, or to add a standardized API to models. Related to this, the OMF may also coordinate or help develop and maintain a common ontology database to facilitate interoperability.\nThe OMF may also adopt and promote common metadata standards for model code repositories to improve discoverability and access for models located across diverse, internationl archives.\nIt may also develop and maintain a global, online index to non-computational models (e.g., numerical, and conceptual) that meet OMF standards for documentation, reuse, and transparency.\nThe OMF may make available to modeling scientists information and guidance about Open Source licensing and other practices for making their work globally accessible.\nTraining and Education The OMF will provide a forum for disseminating materials for teaching best practices for model documentation, transparency, reuse, and interoperability to students in educational institutions. Related to this, the OMF may sponsor training activities to help scientists learn how to make their models more transparent, well-documented, reusable by others, or interoperable with other models. This training could involve in-person workshops, webinars and virtual conferences, or training videos.\nCoordination and Partnerships with Other Organizations The OMF will actively engage with other organizations supporting open, ethical science. It will do so in order to support and promote best practices for modeling science. This could include adopting standards for ethical practice, identifying open access repositories for model code and other information, and obtaining support for licensing and related legal issues.\nThe OMF also will actively engage with journals that publish the results of modeling science. It will encourage these journals to actively support OMF standards by requiring scientists to meet these standards in order to publish their work, and assigning digital badges or other public recognition of authors who do so.\nSeeking Funding The Open Modeling Foundation, through its Administrative Directorate and its member organizations, will seek external funding to support the activities of the foundation.\nAdditional Activities Depending on resource availability, the Open Modeling Foundation may undertake other activities in support of modeling science and scientists. Identifying, prioritizing, and coordinating such activities will be the responsibility of the Executive Directorate and Activities Committees. The following are examples of such activities.\n Membership The Open Modeling Foundation is comprised of organizations that include and represent modeling scientists anywhere in the world. Any such organization can be nominated for membership in the OMF or self-nominate. Nominations will be evaluated by the Executive Directorate and presented to the Membership Council for approval. Membership is supported by donations and assume active voluntary participation of members in the Foundation activities.\n Governance Governance of the Open Modeling Foundation should be organized to achieve four primary goals:\n  It should enable the foundation to carry out its mission and goals, and realize its vision in the most effective way possible and with the least necessary intervention on the part of OMF governance.\n  It should provide a free and fair voice to all member scientific communities it represents.\n  It should offer opportunities for all modeling scientists to participate and contribute to the goals and activities of the OMF.\n  It should seek to maximize benefits for the scientific communities it represents and promote modeling science that benefits both human and natural systems on our planet.\n  The policies and activities of Open Modeling Foundation will be administered by shared, multi-level governance, consisting on a Members Council, Working Groups, and Executive Directorate.\nMembers Council The Members Council is composed of 1 representative from each member organization. The Members Council reviews and approves OMF policies and modeling standards. It provide advices and support to the Executive Directorate and Working Groups for carrying out governance policies, creating and administering standards, and carrying out other activities. It also]{style=\u0026quot;background: transparent\u0026rdquo;} facilitates communication between the Open Modeling Foundation and modeling scientists represented by OMF member organization. Nominations for new members must be approved by a majority of the Members Council.\nThe Members Council will meet annually in person and quarterly virtually.\nChanges to the OMF Charter requires approval by a vote of 2/3 of the Members Council.\nExecutive Directorate Regular activities and financial management of the OMF is guided by the Executive Directorate. The Executive Directorate is composed of an Executive Director, two representatives elected by the Members Council, and the Chairs of the Working Groups. The two Members Council representatives are elected in staggered two year terms. The Executive Director serves for renewable five year terms. The other members of the Executive Directorate and the Members Council will create a process for selecting an Executive Director.\nThe Executive Directorate ensures that the activities of the Open Modeling Foundation are furthering its vision, mission, and goals as expressed in this charter. It oversees all elections and any other selection of individuals involved in foundation activities to ensure that qualified, ethical individuals who are dedicated to the foundation\u0026rsquo;s vision, mission, and goals are chosen to fill their roles in the foundation. It also oversees the activities committees to ensure that they are carrying out their assigned tasks in an appropriate and effective manner, consistent with the vision, mission, and goals of the foundation. The Executive Directorate receives and evaluates all nominations for membership in the Open Modeling Foundation, and submits them to the Members Council for review and approval vote. The Executive Directorate also manages funding and financial expenditures of the OMF, in accordance with the foundation\u0026rsquo;s vision, mission, and goals. The Executive Directorate may propose changes to the OMF Charter for review and approval by the Membership Council.\nThe Executive Directorate will meet at least quarterly each year. It will organize Members Council meetings. The Executive Director will chair Directorate meetings and Members Council meetings, or identify a substitute from the Directorate if s/he is unable to do so. The Executive Directorate may be supported by OMF staff including an Administrative Coordinator and technical staff.\nWorking Groups In addition to the Executive Directorate, OMF activities are guided by Working Groups. Any modeling scientist can join a Working Group. Working Groups will self organize, and nominate a Working Group Chair, for approval by the Members Council. Working Group Chairs serve for a three-year, renewable term.\nStandards Working Group The Standards Working Group oversees the adoption, dissemination, and administration of OMF standards for access, documentation, reusability, and interoperability; it may also propose additional standards. It proposes standards to be reviewed, revised, and approved by the OMF Members Council. The SWG works with the Executive Directorate and Administrative Coordinator to communicate OMF standards to OMF member organizations and other stakeholders, and solicit input from the modeling community. It also establishs procedures to evaluate and certify model code that meets OFM standards, working with code repositories and scientific software journals to ensure that code review includes OMF criteria and that OMF digital badges are awarded for models that comply with these standards.\nCyberinfrastructure Working Group The Cyberinfrastructure Working Group serves to identify or develop tools and processes which serve to lower the technical barriers towards adoption of the standards developed by the Standards Working Group. The Cyberinfrastructure Working Group also identifies ways to best deploy these tools and sufficient documentation to enable their use to modeling scientists. This Working Group also coordinates the development and management of the OMF Science Gateway. The CWG will be assisted by OMF technical staff in its mission. These OMF technical staff will be de faOutreach and Education Committee*.*\nThe Outreach and Education Committee will coordinate collaborative efforts with journals, funding agencies, societies, institutions/labs, other software/modeling consortia to diseminate and administer OMF standards across the community of modeling science.
