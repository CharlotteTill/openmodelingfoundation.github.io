The Executive Committee (EC) ensures that the activities of the Open Modeling Foundation further its vision, mission, and goals as expressed in the organizational [charter](https://openmodelingfoundation.github.io/governance/charter/#executive-committee). It oversees all elections and any other selection of individuals involved in OMF activities to ensure that qualified, ethical individuals who are dedicated to the foundation’s vision, mission, and goals are chosen to fill their roles in the OMF. It also oversees the Working Group activities to ensure that they are carrying out their respective responsibilities in an appropriate and effective manner, consistent with the vision, mission, and goals of the OMF.

Elected members of the EC serve staggered three-year terms.
