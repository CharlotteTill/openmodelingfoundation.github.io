The Executive Committee (EC) ensures that the activities of the Open Modeling Foundation further its vision, mission, and goals as expressed in the organizational [charter](https://openmodelingfoundation.github.io/governance/charter/#executive-committee). It oversees all elections and any other selection of individuals involved in OMF activities to ensure that qualified, ethical individuals who are dedicated to the foundation’s vision, mission, and goals are chosen to fill their roles in the OMF. It also oversees the Working Group activities to ensure that they are carrying out their respective responsibilities in an appropriate and effective manner, consistent with the vision, mission, and goals of the OMF.

Elected members of the EC serve staggered three-year terms.

<div class="card mb-4 border-0">
<p> <br> Karin Frank heads the Department for Ecological Modeling (<a href="https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=34213">OESA</a>) at the Helmholtz-Centre for Environmental Research – UFZ in Leipzig (Germany) and holds a joint Professorship with the Institute for Environmental Systems Research at the University of Osnabrück (Germany). Her research centers on modeling the structure, dynamics, functions and stability properties of ecological, eco-hydrological and social-ecological systems under the influence of global change (esp. climate, land use and institutional change). At the Helmholtz-Centre, her department focuses on terrestrial environmental modeling, earth observation and data science, along with the development and application of concepts, methodologies, tools and workflows in these fields. The aims of this research spans analysis of terrestrial environmental systems and the development of sustainable solutions for real-world problems in landscapes under transition. OESA has contributed substantially to the development of community standards for the description of social-environmental models, the use of models for effectively influencing decision-making in real-world contexts, and the operationalization of social theories of human behavior in models for social-ecological systems. </p>
