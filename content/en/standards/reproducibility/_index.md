These standards promote the reuse of model code and reproducibility of model results.

Reproduciblity is a cornerstone of scientific research, especially for transparent evaluation of research claims. Equally important is the potential for scientific procedures to be reused and modified in order to carry out new research. While clear documentation is essential to reusability, new technologies also offer the potential to increase the reproducibility and reusability of model code. A critical metric of reproducibility is whether a model can consistently reproduce the published results that claim to have been generated by the model. Reproducibility and reusability can also be enhanced if model code is accompanied by explicit workflows, or workflow scripts.
